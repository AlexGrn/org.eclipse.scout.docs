With this tutorial you will learn how to import existing Scout Demo Application into your workspace. 

==== Import projects

Open the Import wizard with the File => Import... Menu.
In the dialog select "Projects into Workspace" and click on Next.

In the next Step:

As long as the Eclipse Scout project is not integrated in the default catalog, you need to import the setup file manually.
Click on the green plus icon "Add user projects" (top right corner).
In the Dialog:

* Select "Eclipse Projects" as Catalog
* Enter the URI to our Setup File: `https://git.eclipse.org/c/scout/oomph.git/plain/Scout.setup`

When the project is available in the catalog:

* [1] search for the "Scout Demo App".
* [2] add it to the list of projects with the "Add Projects" arrow button.
* [3] adjust the Stream: select the latest milestone release (called "Neon (M4 release)" by time of writing).

Click on Next.

User variables are cached by Oomph (for example, choices selected previously).
To display all variables activate the Checkbox "Show all Variables" in the bottom left corner.

It is important to set the variables that correspond to your use case.

* Git clone location rule: select the pattern that correspond to your workflow (If you do not know the pattern corresponding to "Located in a folder named '.git/{lt}repo{gt}' within the workspace folder" is probably the easiest one to use)
* Target Platform: default good ("None" because we do not used Target platform)
* JRE 1.7 Location: put here the path to a Java 7 JRE
* JRE 1.8 Location: put here the path to a Java 8 JRE
* Scout Github repository: if you do not have a GitHub account the pattern corresponding to "HTTPS (read-only, anonymous)" is the easiest to use.


==== Start the application

Open the `contacts-all-dev.launch` file in the `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.all.app.dev` project.

image::{imgsdir}/run_contracts_all_dev.png[]

Select "Run As => contacts-all-dev".

Open the application in a web browser: http://localhost:8082/

==== What's Next?

Try the Contracts application out.
It will give you an overview of what you can do with Scout.
You can browse through the data and open the different forms.

Have a look at the code.
The Scout Team welcomes pull requests with improvements.
