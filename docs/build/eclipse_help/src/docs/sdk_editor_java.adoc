Scout uses the standard Java Editor as provided by Eclipse.
In order to ease the development, some additional features are added the Editor.

===== Create new Scout Elements

To create new Scout Elements (like Form-Fields, Codes, Columns, Extensions, Form-Handlers, Key-Strokes or Menus) some additional proposals are available in the content assist.
With kbd:[Ctrl,Space] the depending on the context, additional templates can be selected to create the corresponding inner-classes.
<<img-java_proposals_groupbox>> provides an example the content assist proposal in a `GroupBox` context and <<img-java_proposals_table>> does the same for a `Table`

[[img-java_proposals_groupbox, Figure Proposals in a GroupBox]]
.Proposals to create new entities in a GroupBox
image::{imgsdir}/java_proposals_groupbox.png[]

[[img-java_proposals_table, Figure Proposals in a Table]]
.Proposals to create new entities in a Table
image::{imgsdir}/java_proposals_table.png[]

When a template is selected, it is possible to customized it by navigating between the different Edit-Groups with the kbd:[Tab] Key (this works exactly like other templates in the Eclipse Editor).
With this mechanism you can quickly define the class name, the parent class and other properties.
With kbd:[Enter] you will exit the Edit-Mode.

===== NLS-Entry support

When the carret is inside the String parameter of the `TEXTS.get()` code, the content assist provide support for the NLS entries.
<<img-java_proposals_texts>> provides an example.

[[img-java_proposals_texts, Figure Proposals in a TEXTS.get()]]
.Proposals corresponding to NLS Support.

You can select one of the matching entries (like "DateOfBirth" in the example) and you will see the different translations on the right.

You can select "New text..." to open the <<sdk_wizard_nls-entry.adoc#, NLS Entry Wizard>>.
