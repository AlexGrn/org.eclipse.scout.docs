== A One Day Tutorial

In this chapter we will create the "`Contacts`" Scout application. 
The goal of this tutorial application is to learn about the most prominent features of the Eclipse Scout framework using a fully functioning application. 

The application is kept small enough to complete this tutorial within less than a day.
An extended version of "`Contacts`" is available as a Scout sample application on https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/6.0.x/code/contacts[Github].

As a prerequisite to this tutorial we assume that the reader has successfully completed the chapters "Hello World Tutorial" and "Import the Scout Demo Applications" as described in the Eclipse Scout user guide.
To access the Scout user guide help hit kbd:[F1] in the Eclipse IDE.
This opens the Eclipse help view that includes the Eclipse Scout User Guide as shown in <<img-sdk_f1>>.

The "`Contacts`" tutorial is organized as follows.
In the first section, the finished "`Contacts`" application is explained from the user perspective.
The remaining sections focus on the individual steps to implement the "`Contacts`" tutorial application.

[[sec-adding_the_smartfield]]
==== Adding the Company Smartfield

At the current stage of the "`My Contacts`" application, we have no option to manage the relationship between people and companies.
To manage this relation, we now add a company smart field to the person form.
This smart field will then hold the current assignment of the person represented in the person form.

A Scout smart field can be viewed as user friendly dropdown field on steroids that also implements [element]_search-as-you-type_ to pick a specific entry.
In the simplest case the smart field provides access to a small and locally provided list of key value pairs.
But for the intended use in the "`My Contacts`" application, we will need to access a list of elements provided by the server that will be compiled dynamically at runtime.

image::{imgsdir}/new_lookupcall_company_2.png[]

To create the access to this list, we start with the creation of the company lookup call.
As shown in <<img-new_lookupcall_company_contextmenu>> the lookup call is added on the [folder]_Lookup Calls_ folder under the green shared node of the "`My Contacts`" application.
This opens the [wizard]_New Lookup Call_ wizard as shown in <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>.
In the first wizard step, enter "`Company`" into the [field]_Class Name_ field, "`services.lookup`" into the [field]_Sub Package_ field and "`String`" into the [field]_Key Type_ field.
Now verify that the wizard step looks the same as the screenshot shown on the left hand side of <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>.
Before the wizard is closed, click on the btn:[Next] button to move to the second wizard step.
As shown on the right hand side of <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>, the wizard will also create a corresponding [java]+CompanyLookupService+ on the application's server.
We can now close this wizard with the btn:[Finish] button and add the business logic to this company lookup service.

(((LookupCall, getConfiguredService, CompanyLookupCall)))
[[lst-mycontacts.shared.lookup.companylookupcall, Listing CompanyLookupCall]]
[source,java]
.The company lookup call with its [java]+getConfiguredService+ method in the application's shared plugin.

(((AbstractSqlLookupService, getConfiguredSqlSelect)))
[[lst-mycontacts.server.lookup.companylookupservice, Listing CompanyLookupService]]
[source,java]
.The company lookup service in the application's server plugin. The [java]+key+ and the [java]+text+ criteria are used to search for values by key or by the provided name substring.

----


The [java]+CompanyLookupCall+ just created by the Scout SDK wizard is provided in <<lst-mycontacts.shared.lookup.companylookupcall>>.
As we can see, the only method implemented is [java]+getConfiguredService+ that points to the specific server service to be used.
In the Scout Explorer, the new company lookup service can be found in the [folder]_Lookup Services_ folder under the blue server node of the application.
In this service, we need to implement method [java]+getConfiguredSqlSelect+ as shown in <<lst-mycontacts.server.lookup.companylookupservice>>.
For Scout lookup services, specific [element]_key_, [element]_text_ and [element]_all_ criteria blocks need to be provided.
This criteria are included in the [java]+SELECT+ statement using the [java]+<key>+, [java]+<text>+ and [java]+<all>+ tags as shown in the listing.
The Scout runtime uses the [java]+<key>+-block in cases where a specific key is already assigned to the smart field.
The [java]+<text>+-block is used as a query criteria to create the dynamic [element]_search-as-you-type_ hit list based on the (sub)string entered by the user so far.
Finally, the [java]+<all>+-block is used to define the hit list to be shown when the user does not enter any text into the smart field but clicks on the field's search icon instead.
The bind variable [java]+:key+ and [java]+:text+ are provided by Scout and hold the value of the assigned key or the text entered into the smart field.

image::{imgsdir}/new_smartfield_company_2.png[]

We are now ready to add the company smart field to the person form.
To start the [wizard]_New Form Field_ wizard we use the context menu on the [java]+DetailBox+ of the person form as shown in <<img-new_smartfield_company>>.
In the first wizard step, we chose the [element]_SmartField_ entry as the field type and click the btn:[Next] button.
Then, we enter "`Company`" into the [field]_Name_ field as shown on the right hand side of <<img-new_smartfield_company>>.
Make sure that you select the [element]_String_ entry in the [field]_Generic Type_ field as we are using string values to identify companies in the "`My Contacts`" application.
And in the [field]_LookupCall_ field, we can now select the [element]_CompanyLookupCall_ that we have just created before.
Finally, the position of the new company smart field can be set in the [field]_Sibling_ field before the location field before the wizard is closed with the btn:[Finish] button.

The implementation of the company smart field created by the Scout SDK wizard is provided in <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.companyfield>>.
A look at the implementation of the [java]+CompanyField+ class shows the wiring with the company lookup service.
