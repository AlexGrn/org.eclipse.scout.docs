== A One Day Tutorial

In this chapter we will create the "`Contacts`" Scout application. 
The goal of this tutorial application is to learn about the most prominent features of the Eclipse Scout framework using a fully functioning application. 

The application is kept small enough to complete this tutorial within less than a day.
An extended version of "`Contacts`" is available as a Scout sample application on https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/6.0.x/code/contacts[Github].

As a prerequisite to this tutorial we assume that the reader has successfully completed the chapters "Hello World Tutorial" and "Import the Scout Demo Applications" as described in the Eclipse Scout user guide.
To access the Scout user guide help hit kbd:[F1] in the Eclipse IDE.
This opens the Eclipse help view that includes the Eclipse Scout User Guide as shown in <<img-sdk_f1>>.

[[img-sdk_f1, Figure 000]]
.The Eclipse help view including the Eclipse Scout User Guide.

The "`Contacts`" tutorial is organized as follows.
In the first section, the finished "`Contacts`" application is explained from the user perspective.
The remaining sections focus on the individual steps to implement the "`Contacts`" tutorial application.

== OLD STUFF


==== A simple Form to edit the Picture URL

[[img-new_form_url, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/new_form_url_1.png[]
.Add the URL editor form. This form does not need any connections to the server. Therefore, the related components such as services and the form data can be removed in the second wizard step shown on the right side.
image::{imgsdir}/new_form_url_2.png[]

To edit a person's picture link, we create a simple URL editor form as shown in <<img-new_form_url>>.
As we only need this form to update the URL information of a person's picture field, we do not need any connectivity to the backend of the "`My Contacts`" application.
That is why almost all form and service artefacts are deselected in the second wizard step shown on the right side of <<img-new_form_url>>.

[[lst-mycontacts.client.forms.pictureurl, Listing PictureURLField]]
[source,java]
.The UI structure of the [java]+PictureURLForm+ used to update the URL of the picture field in the person form.
----
TODO include was {codedir}/oneDayTutorial/org.eclipsescout.contacts.client/src/org/eclipsescout/contacts/client/ui/forms/PictureURLForm.java[lines=24..25;99..113;122..122;126..127]
----


As this form only holds a single URL field, we omit the description of the creation of the URL editor form's content and provide the resulting Java code instead.
In <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.pictureurl>> just the form's [java]+MainBox+ code is shown.

[[img-new_menu_editurl, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/new_menu_editurl_contextmenu.png[]
.Add the URL edit menu to the picture field.
image::{imgsdir}/new_menu_editurl.png[]

This form is then started via an "`Edit URL ...`" contextmenu on the image field.
The creation of this contextmenu is shown in <<img-new_menu_editurl>>.
See <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.picturefield.editmenu>> for the actual implementation of the [java]+execAction+ for this contextmenu.

(((execAction)))
[[lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.picturefield.editmenu, Listing EditURLMenu]]
[source,java]
.The edit menu implemented in class [java]+EditURLMenu+ of the picture field. If the URL was changed the picture URL field of the person form is set accordingly in method [java]+execAction+
----
TODO include was {codedir}/oneDayTutorial/org.eclipsescout.contacts.client/src/org/eclipsescout/contacts/client/ui/forms/PersonForm.java[lines=268..285]
----


Once the edit URL form is started with [java]+form.startModify()+ the client waits in method [java]+form.waitFor+ until the form is closed by the user.
If the user has changed any field content (the picture URL in our case) and closed the form with the btn:[OK] button, the method [java]+form.isFormStored+ returns true, and we can copy the new URL from the editor form field into the picture URL field of the person form.
Such a change will then trigger method [java]+execChangedMasterValue+ of the [java]+PictureField+ which in turn updates the image shown in the person form.


[[sec-adding_the_smartfield]]
==== Adding the Company Smartfield

At the current stage of the "`My Contacts`" application, we have no option to manage the relationship between people and companies.
To manage this relation, we now add a company smart field to the person form.
This smart field will then hold the current assignment of the person represented in the person form.

A Scout smart field can be viewed as user friendly dropdown field on steroids that also implements [element]_search-as-you-type_ to pick a specific entry.
In the simplest case the smart field provides access to a small and locally provided list of key value pairs.
But for the intended use in the "`My Contacts`" application, we will need to access a list of elements provided by the server that will be compiled dynamically at runtime.

[[img-new_lookupcall_company_contextmenu, Figure 000]]
.Add a lookup call to the applications shared node.
image::{imgsdir}/new_lookupcall_company_contextmenu.png[]

image::{imgsdir}/new_lookupcall_company_1.png[]
.The two wizard steps to enter the details of the company lookup call.
image::{imgsdir}/new_lookupcall_company_2.png[]

To create the access to this list, we start with the creation of the company lookup call.
As shown in <<img-new_lookupcall_company_contextmenu>> the lookup call is added on the [folder]_Lookup Calls_ folder under the green shared node of the "`My Contacts`" application.
This opens the [wizard]_New Lookup Call_ wizard as shown in <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>.
In the first wizard step, enter "`Company`" into the [field]_Class Name_ field, "`services.lookup`" into the [field]_Sub Package_ field and "`String`" into the [field]_Key Type_ field.
Now verify that the wizard step looks the same as the screenshot shown on the left hand side of <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>.
Before the wizard is closed, click on the btn:[Next] button to move to the second wizard step.
As shown on the right hand side of <<img-new_lookupcall_company>>, the wizard will also create a corresponding [java]+CompanyLookupService+ on the application's server.
We can now close this wizard with the btn:[Finish] button and add the business logic to this company lookup service.

(((LookupCall, getConfiguredService, CompanyLookupCall)))
[[lst-mycontacts.shared.lookup.companylookupcall, Listing CompanyLookupCall]]
[source,java]
.The company lookup call with its [java]+getConfiguredService+ method in the application's shared plugin.

----


(((AbstractSqlLookupService, getConfiguredSqlSelect)))
[[lst-mycontacts.server.lookup.companylookupservice, Listing CompanyLookupService]]
[source,java]
.The company lookup service in the application's server plugin. The [java]+key+ and the [java]+text+ criteria are used to search for values by key or by the provided name substring.
----
TODO include was {codedir}/oneDayTutorial/org.eclipsescout.contacts.server/src/org/eclipsescout/contacts/server/services/lookup/CompanyLookupService.java[lines=6..20]
----


The [java]+CompanyLookupCall+ just created by the Scout SDK wizard is provided in <<lst-mycontacts.shared.lookup.companylookupcall>>.
As we can see, the only method implemented is [java]+getConfiguredService+ that points to the specific server service to be used.
In the Scout Explorer, the new company lookup service can be found in the [folder]_Lookup Services_ folder under the blue server node of the application.
In this service, we need to implement method [java]+getConfiguredSqlSelect+ as shown in <<lst-mycontacts.server.lookup.companylookupservice>>.
For Scout lookup services, specific [element]_key_, [element]_text_ and [element]_all_ criteria blocks need to be provided.
This criteria are included in the [java]+SELECT+ statement using the [java]+<key>+, [java]+<text>+ and [java]+<all>+ tags as shown in the listing.
The Scout runtime uses the [java]+<key>+-block in cases where a specific key is already assigned to the smart field.
The [java]+<text>+-block is used as a query criteria to create the dynamic [element]_search-as-you-type_ hit list based on the (sub)string entered by the user so far.
Finally, the [java]+<all>+-block is used to define the hit list to be shown when the user does not enter any text into the smart field but clicks on the field's search icon instead.
The bind variable [java]+:key+ and [java]+:text+ are provided by Scout and hold the value of the assigned key or the text entered into the smart field.

.Create the company smart field for the person form. In the second wizard step shown on the right side, first remove the content in the [field]_Generic Type_ field and then select the company lookup call into the corresponding field.
image::{imgsdir}/new_smartfield_company_2.png[]

We are now ready to add the company smart field to the person form.
To start the [wizard]_New Form Field_ wizard we use the context menu on the [java]+DetailBox+ of the person form as shown in <<img-new_smartfield_company>>.
In the first wizard step, we chose the [element]_SmartField_ entry as the field type and click the btn:[Next] button.
Then, we enter "`Company`" into the [field]_Name_ field as shown on the right hand side of <<img-new_smartfield_company>>.
Make sure that you select the [element]_String_ entry in the [field]_Generic Type_ field as we are using string values to identify companies in the "`My Contacts`" application.
And in the [field]_LookupCall_ field, we can now select the [element]_CompanyLookupCall_ that we have just created before.
Finally, the position of the new company smart field can be set in the [field]_Sibling_ field before the location field before the wizard is closed with the btn:[Finish] button.

The implementation of the company smart field created by the Scout SDK wizard is provided in <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.companyfield>>.
A look at the implementation of the [java]+CompanyField+ class shows the wiring with the company lookup service.


==== Adding the Map Form

We now want to add the "`Map`" form shown in the front of <<img-my_contacts_swt>>.
The purpose of this form is to show a map corresponding to the address entered into the [field]_location_ field of the person form using the Google Maps Image API.footnote:[
The Google Maps Image API can be used to fetch static map images: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/imageapis/.
].
This implies that map images will only be shown in the map form if the entered address can be parsed by the Google Maps Image API.

To create the maps form we start the [wizard]_New Form_ wizard and enter the new translated text "`Map`" into the [field]_Name_ field and "`ui.forms`" into the [field]_Sub Package_ field of the first wizard step.
Then, we click the btn:[Next] button to configure the artefacts to be created by the wizard.
For the map form we can use the configuration as shown on the right hand side of <<img-new_form_url>> with the difference that we do not need the cancel button.
Having deselected all artefacts except for the ok button and the modify handler, the wizard can be closed with the btn:[Finish] button.

After the form creation wizard has been closed, we can add an "`Address`" variable to the form by starting the [wizard]_New Property Bean_ wizard on the [node]_Variables_ node of the newly created map form.
In the property bean wizard, enter "`Address`" into the [field]_Name_ field and set the [field]_Bean type_ field to [element]_String_.

As the next step, the map image field is added to the from.
For this, start the [wizard]_New Form Field_ wizard directly on the form's [node]_MainBox_ node.
In the first form field wizard step, select [element]_ImageField_ as the field type and click on the btn:[Next] button.
Now enter "`Map`" into the [field]_Class Name_ field and close the second wizard step with the btn:[Finish] button.
To set the properties of the new map field, select the [node]_MapField_ node below the main box node of the map form.
In the [java]+MapField+'s Scout Object Properties untick the [property]_Label Visible_ property and add an [java]+execInitField+ method by clicking on the green plus icon next to this operation.
The configuration of the map field can then be completed in section [element]_Advanced Properties_.
Here, we set the [property]_Grid H_ property to 6 and update the [property]_Width in Pixel_ property and the [property]_Height in Pixel_ property to a value of 400 each.

(((execInitField, AbstractImageField)))
[[lst-mycontacts.client.forms.map, Listing execInitField]]
[source,java]
.In the [java]+execInitField+ method of the map form the image content is fetched from the Google Maps API.
----
TODO include was {codedir}/oneDayTutorial/org.eclipsescout.contacts.client/src/org/eclipsescout/contacts/client/ui/forms/MapForm.java[lines=115..133]
----


To add the Java code to display the map in the image field, click on the [link]_execInitField_ link in the Scout Object Properties of the map field.
According to the implementation provided in <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.map>>, an URL for the Maps Image API is first constructed.
This url also contains the content of the map form's address variable and the configured dimension of the map field.
The map picture returned by the Google API is then read using [java]+IOUtility.getContent+ and directly fed into the image fields `setImage` method.

The last step involving the implementation of the map form feature is its integration into the person form.
As visible on the lower left part of the person form shown in <<img-my_contacts_swt>>, a [link]_Show Map ..._ link is available.
We now add such a link to the person form including the necessary wiring for opening the newly created map form.
For this, navigate to the person form in the Scout SDK and click on its [node]_MainBox_ node below.
Then, open the context menu on the [node]_MainBox_ node and start the [wizard]_New Form Field_ wizard.
In the first wizard step, select the [element]_LinkButton_ from the available field types and click the btn:[Next] button to load the second wizard step.
Here, just enter the new translated text "`Show Map ...`" into the [field]_Name_ field and close the wizard with the btn:[Finish] button.

(((execClickAction)))
[[lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.clickmaplink, Listing ShowMapButton]]
[source,java]
.The implementation of the "`Show Map ...`" link button. %In method `execClickAction` a new map form is first created, the the address variable is set with the content of the person's location and the form is opened with `startModify`.
----
TODO include was {codedir}/oneDayTutorial/org.eclipsescout.contacts.client/src/org/eclipsescout/contacts/client/ui/forms/PersonForm.java[lines=347..362]
----


To add the necessary wiring code to the link button double click the [node]_ShowMapButton_ node in the Scout Explorer and implement its [java]+execClickAction+ method.
As shown in <<lst-mycontacts.client.forms.person.clickmaplink>>, we only need to create a new map form in the click action, set its address variable and open the form with [java]+form.startModify+.


=== Creating the Company Form

Creating the company form and the necessary backend services is not described here.
Instead, this task is left as an exercise to the reader and in the text below some minimal guidelines are provided.

To create the company form, start with the [wizard]_New Form_ wizard as in the case of the person form.
This will then create all necessary artefacts including the forms, the server service, and the form data for the communication between the client and the server.
And don't forget to add a [java]+companyId+ variable to the company form.
To decide on the fields that need to be on the company form you may check the setup of the database schema provided in <<lst-mycontacts.server.services.installdb.company>>.
If in doubt about what to do, please refer to the procedure used to create the person form.

In case you get lost completely, you may download the "`My Contacts`" application from this books Github repository as described in the Scout wiki.footnote:[
Download and installation of the "`My Contacts`" application: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Book/4.0#Download_and_Run_the_Scout_Sample_Applications.
