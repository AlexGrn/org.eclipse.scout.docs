This section deals with setting up the initial workspace and codebase for the "Contacts" application. 
The goal of this step lies in the project setup that closely matches the "Contacts" application. 
This includes the organization and naming of Maven modules and the individual Java packages.

The creation up of the initial project setup described in this section consists of the tasks listed below.

* <<sec-contacts_initial_codebase>>
* <<sec-contacts_remove_stuff>>
* <<sec-contacts_change_workoutline>>
* <<sec-contacts_change_desktop>>

This first step of the "Contacts" tutorial ends with a review of the results of this first tutorial step in section <<sec-contacts_summary>>.

[[sec-contacts_initial_codebase]]
==== Creating the initial Codebase

The initial code for the "`Contacts`" application is generated using the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard as described in Section <<sec-wizard_new_project>>.
For the wizard fiels you may use the following values:

* [field]_Group Id_: `org.eclipse.scout.contacts`
* [field]_Artefact Id_: `org.eclipse.scout.contacts`
* [field]_Display Name_: "Contacts Application"

To create this initial application click on btn:[Finish].
The project wizard then creates a number of Maven modules as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>>.

[[sec-contacts_remove_stuff]]
==== Removing unnecessery Components

We start with removing the `\*.helloworld` and `\*.settings` packages in all Maven modules of the "Contacts" application. 
To delete a packages first select an individual package or packages in the Eclipse package explorer as shown in <<img-contacts_package_explorer>> and then hit the kbd:[Delete] key.
The explicit list of packages to delete per Maven module is provided in the text below. 

Client Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.settings` 
* In folder `src/test/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.helloworld` 

Server Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld` 
* In folder `src/test/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.helloworld` 

Shared Module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared`::
* In folder `src/main/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld` 
* In folder `src/generated/java` 
** Delete package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared.helloworld` 

[[sec-contacts_change_workoutline]]
==== Changes to Class WorkOutline

Instead of adding a new "Contacts" outline to the application re simply reuse and rename the "Work" outline that was created during the initial project setup. 
For this, we perform the following modifications to class WorkOutline.

* Rename the class package to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact`
* Rename the class to `ContactOutline`
* Change the outline title to "Contact"
* Change the outline icon to `Icons.Category`

To quickly find the class we open the [wizard]_Open Type_ dialog from the Eclipse IDE footnote:[
Type 'open type' into the [field]_Quick Access_ field of the Eclipse IDE or hit `Ctrl`,`Shift`, and `T` at the same time.
]
and enter 'workoutline' into the search field as shown in <<img-eclipse_open_type>>.
In the result list, we select the desired class and click the btn:[OK] button to open the file `WorkOutline.java` in the Java editor of the Eclipse IDE.

[[img-eclipse_open_type, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/eclipse_open_type.png[]
.Use the Open Type dialog to quickly find java types in the Eclipse IDE.

We start with the package rename.
To rename the package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.work` to `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.contact` click into the package name and using the Eclipse menu menu:Refactor[Rename...].
This opens the package rename dialog as shown in <<img-sdk_rename_package>>.

[[img-sdk_rename_package, Figure 000]]
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_rename_package.png[]
.Use the Eclipse Rename Package dialog to rename a Java package.

In next step we rename class `WorkOutline` to `ContactOutline` 
In the Java editor we can then rename the class by clicking into the class identifier `WorkOutline` and use the Eclipse menu menu:Refactor[Rename...] again.
Inside the edit box we can then change the class name to `ContactOutline` and hit the btn:[Enter] key to execute the change. 
If Eclipse shows a Rename Type dialog just hit button btn:[Continue] to let Eclipse complete the rename operation.

Now, we change the outline title in method `getConfiguredTitle` to "Contacts" using the method described in <<sec-add_text_entry>>.
Finally we change the return value of method `getConfiguredIconId` to value `Icons.Category`.

----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=OutlineInit]
----

Before we conclude the modifications in class ContactOutline let us remove the remaining compile error in class `ContactOutline`. 
For this remove the line `pageList.add(new HelloWorldPage());` in method `execCreateChildPages`.
Then, update the imports using Eclipse menu menu:Source[Organize Imports] and save the modified class.

[[sec-contacts_change_desktop]]
==== Changes to Class Desktop

The second class to adapt for the "Contacts" application is class Desktop. 
This class is implemented exactly once in each Scout application and holds the available outlines and top level menus of the application in the form of inner classes.

For the "Contacts" application we adapt the initial implementation to have outline view buttons for the "Contacts" and "Search" outlines. 
The top level menus are then adapted to hold the menus "Quick Access", "Options" and a menu for the logged in user. 

Start with removing `SettingsOutline.class` from the list of return values in `getConfiguredOutlines` as shown in <<lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines>>.

[[lst-contacts_getConfiguredOutlines, Listing getConfiguredOutlines]]
[source,java]
.Method getConfiguredOutlines defines the outlines associated with the desktop of the application.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/Desktop.java[tags=getConfiguredOutlines]
----

Then, perform the following changes in class `Desktop`

* Delete inner class SettingOutlineViewButton
* Rename inner class WorkOutlineViewButton to ContactOutlineViewButton
* Change FileMenu to QuickAccesMenu and let `getConfiguredText` return "Quick Access"
* Change BookmarkMenu to OptionsMenu. Let `getConfiguredText` return "Options", and add method `getConfiguredIconId` to return `AbstractIcons.Gear`.
* Change HelpMenu to UserMenuLet. `getConfiguredText` return "", and add method `getConfiguredIconId` to return `AbstractIcons.Person`.

At the end of these changes the inner class structure of class Desktop will look like shown in <<lst-contacts_desktop>>.

The explicit listing for the changed class OptionsMenu is provided in <<lst-contacts_OptionsMenu>>. 
Please note that for now your class `OptionsMenu` will just extend `AbstractMenu`.

[[sec-contacts_summary]]
==== What have we achieved?

In the first step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have created the initial project setup that will serve as the basis for all the following tutorial steps. 

As the "Contacts" application is in a clean state you can now test the application using the following steps.
The user interface of the application will now look as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1>>.

* Start the backend application
* Start the frontend application
* Open address in your http://localhost:8082/[http://localhost:8082/] browser

[[img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_1, Figure 000]]
.The "Contacts" application at the end of tutorial step 1.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_tutorial_result_step_1.png[]

From the coding perspective we now have all necessary maven Modules for "Contacts" application including Java package and class names to match with the complete Scout "Contacts" demo application. 
This fact is very important as simplifies the comparison of intermediate stages of the tutorial application with the Scout demo application. 
The same is true for the user perspective: The layout of the current state of the tutorial matches with the complete "Contacts" sample application.
