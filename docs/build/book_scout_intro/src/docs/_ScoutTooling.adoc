== Scout Tooling
(((Scout SDK)))

In addition to the Scout runtime framework presented in the previous chapter Eclipse Scout also includes tooling, the Scout SDK.
This tooling provides wizards to create new project and application components, adds code assistance to the Java Editor and comes with a NLS editor to manage all translated text entries of the application.

The Scout SDK provides a set of wizards to create new Scout projects and various components for your Scout applications.

To start any of these wizards press kbd:[Ctrl,N] or use menu menu:File[New,Other...].
In the first wizard step type "_Scout_" into the *Wizards* field as shown in <<img-sdk_wizard_new>>.

Adding a translated text can then be done in the [wizard]_New Entry_ wizard provided by the Scout SDK as shown in <<img-new_text_entry_wizard>>.

[[sec-nls_editor]]
==== The NLS Editor
(((Managing translated application texts)))
(((Adding application languages)))

To manage translated application texts for different languages the Scout SDK includes a NLS editor. 
This editor helps to efficiently deal to edit all the property files that are used with the default setup of Scout.

The NLS editor can be accessed for each text provider service of a Scout application via the `*.nls` files of the shared Maven modules of the application. 
In the case of the "Hello World" application you will find the `Texts.nls` file in module `org.eclipse.scout.helloworld.shared`. 
To open the editor for the "Hello World" application select the `Texts.nls` file first and then use context menu menu:Open With[NLS Editor].
