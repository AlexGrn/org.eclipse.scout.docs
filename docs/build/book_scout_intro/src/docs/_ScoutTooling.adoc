== Scout Tooling
(((Scout SDK)))

This chapter presents the Scout SDK tooling that is included with the Eclipse Scout. 
The Scout SDK provides wizards to create new project and application components, adds code assistance to the Java Editor and comes with a NLS editor to manage all translated text entries of the application.

The chapter is organized as follows. 
Section <<sec-sdk_motivation>> describes the goals and benefits of the tooling included. 
A high level description of the tooling is provided in section <<sec-sdk_overview>>.
Sections <<sec-sdk_wizard>>, <<sec-sdk_content_assist>> and <<sec-sdk_nls>> then provide detailed descriptions of the functionality offered by the Scout SDK.

=== Motivation for the Tooling

[[sec-sdk_overview]]
=== Scout SDK Overview

The Scout SDK tooling helps the Scout developer to quickly create frequently used Scout components. 
This Scout Tooling is implemented as extensions of the Eclipse IDE in the form of wizards, content assist extension to the Eclipse Java editor and support for dealing with translated texts called NLS support.

Scout Wizards::
The Scout SDK tooling includes a number of wizards for the creation of frequently used Scout components. 
In many cases the execution of such wizards involves the creation/editing of several source files. 
In the case of the creation of a new Scout form this includes the form class in the client module of the Scout application, a form data class and a service that communicates 
Descriptions for the individual wizards are provided in section <<sec-sdk_wizard>>.

Content Assist::
In the Scout framework the hierarchical organization of Scout components if frequently reflected in the form of inner classes. 
This allows the Scout tooling to provide context specific proposals in the form of content assist proposals offered in the Java editor of the Eclipse IDE. 
Examples for this form of the tooling includes the creation of form fields or adding columns and context menus to tables.  
Content assist support is described in detail in <<sec-sdk_content_assist>>.

NLS Tooling::
Eclipse Scout comes with NLS (National Language Support). 
To support Scout developers in using Scout's NLS (National Language Support) the Scout SDK offers corresponding tooling to work with translated texts. 
This tooling is described in section <<sec-sdk_nls>>.


[[sec-sdk_wizard]]
=== Scout Wizards
(((SDK Wizard)))

The Scout SDK provides a set of wizards to create new Scout projects and various components for your Scout applications.

To start any of these wizards press kbd:[Ctrl,N] or use menu menu:File[New,Other...].
In the first wizard step type "_Scout_" into the *Wizards* field as shown in <<img-sdk_wizard_new>>.

The Wizards provided by the Scout SDK are introduced and described in the sections listed below.

* <<sec-wizard_project>>  
* <<sec-wizard_page>>  
* <<sec-wizard_form>>

==== Adding a new Translated Text Entry
(((Adding translated text entries)))

Translated text entries are most frequently added when working in the Java editor view.

Adding a translated text can then be done in the [wizard]_New Entry_ wizard provided by the Scout SDK as shown in <<img-new_text_entry_wizard>>.

[[sec-nls_editor]]
==== The NLS Editor
(((Managing translated application texts)))
(((Adding application languages)))

To manage translated application texts for different languages the Scout SDK includes a NLS editor. 
This editor helps to efficiently deal to edit all the property files that are used with the default setup of Scout.

The NLS editor can be accessed for each text provider service of a Scout application via the `*.nls` files of the shared Maven modules of the application. 
In the case of the "Hello World" application you will find the `Texts.nls` file in module `org.eclipse.scout.helloworld.shared`. 
To open the editor for the "Hello World" application select the `Texts.nls` file first and then use context menu menu:Open With[NLS Editor].
