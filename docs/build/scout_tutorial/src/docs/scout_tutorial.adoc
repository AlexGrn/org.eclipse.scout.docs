== A One Day Tutorial

In this tutorial we will create a "`Contacts`" Scout application. 
The goal of this tutorial is to learn about the most prominent features of the Eclipse Scout framework.

Within a single day you will not only have learned more about Scout but also implemented a complete Scout application from the user interface to the data stored in a relational database. 

For this tutorial we assume that you have successfully <<scout_install.adoc#scout_install, installed Eclipse Scout>> and gone through the <<scout_helloworld.adoc#scout_helloworld, "`Hello World`" tutorial>>.

== Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is organized as follows.
In the <<sec-contacts_guide, first section>>, the finished demo application is explained from the user perspective.
The remaining sections listed below focus on the individual steps to implement the "`Contacts`" application.

* Create a new Scout project
* Add a page with a table to display persons
* Add Derby database support
* Add a form to enter/edit persons
* Add a code type for the gender
* Add a lookup call for countries
* Add form field validations
* Add a page and a form to manage companies
* Link the person page to the company page

According to this step-by-step tutorial, we will build an outline based Scout application featuring a navigation tree and pages to present information in tabular form.
In addition, the application also shows how to work with forms to enter and/or update data, menus and context menus.
On the server side, we show how to work with services, databases and how to use logging in Scout applications.

== The "`Contacts`" Application

The "`Contacts`" application is a client server application to manage personal contacts, organizations and events.
The persistence of entered data is achieved via simple JDBC access to a Derby database.

Figure <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> shows the "`Contacts`" application after connecting to the Scout UI application. 
Clicking on a row in the person page activates the [menu]_Edit_ menu which is also available as a context menu on the table row.
The selected person can then be opened in a form to view and edit its data as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

To run the "`Contacts`" application without implementing it first, you may take advantage of the fact that the code of the application is hosted on 
https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/6.0.x/code/contacts[Github]
and start from there.
Alternatively, you can pull a Docker image of the "`Contacts`" application from https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipsescout/org.eclipse.scout.contacts/[Docker Hub].
