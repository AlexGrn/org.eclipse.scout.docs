The Scout Explorer view is responsible for the navigation support within the Scout application model. 
This navigation support is presented in the form of a tree view and includes the client with its UI components, the server and the shared part of a Scout application. 
For the actual navigation in the tree representing the Scout application both the mouse or the keyboard can be used.
