= Client Notifications

In a scout application, typically, the scout client requests some data from the scout server. Sometimes, however, the communication needs go the other way:
The scout server needs to inform the scout client about something.
With client notifications it is possible to do so.

Example scenarios for client notifications are:

* some data shared by client and server has changed (e.g. a cache on the client is no longer up-to-date, or a shared variable has changed)
* a new incoming phone call is available for a specific client and should be shown in the GUI
* a user wants to send a message to another user

Scout itself uses client notifications to synchronize code type and permission caches and session shared variables.

Client notifications are implemented using `long polling` as described below, because long polling works reliably in most corporate networks with proxy servers between server and client
 as well as with security policies that do not allow server push.

With long polling, the client requests notifications from the server repeatedly. If no new notifications are available on the server, instead of sending an empty response,
the server holds the request open and waits until new notifications are available or a timeout is reached.
