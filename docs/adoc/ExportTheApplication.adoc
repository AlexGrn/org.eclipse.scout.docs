At some point during the application development you will want to install your software on a machine that is intended for productive use. 
This is the moment where you need to be able to build and package your Scout application in a way that can be deployed to an application server.

As Scout applications only require a simple servlet container to run, Scout applications can be deployed to almost any Java appliction servers. 
For the purpose of this tutorial we will use http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/index.html[Apache Tomcat]. 

==== Verify the Container Security Settings

First you need to decide if the users of your application should communicate via HTTPS with the Scout frontend server. 
As we strongly recommended this setup for a productive environment even the "`Hello World`" example is configured for this scenario. 
But you need to make sure that your Tomcat installation is configured accordingly.

In case HTTPS support is already enabled for your Tomcat installation, you may skip this section.
Otherwise, follow the steps described in the http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[Tomcat Documentation] to enable SSL/TLS.

If you should prefer to work with HTTP only, you need to modify the security settings of your Scout application.
This can be done in module `helloworld.ui.html.app.war` with the two steps described below.

* In file `config.properties` (in folder `src\main\resources`) add property `scout.auth.cookie.session.validate.secure=false` to disable the check for an encrypted channel (HTTPS).
* In file `web.xml` (in folder `src\main\webapp\WEB-INF`) delete the `<secure>true</secure>` flag in the `<cookie-config>` element.

More on this topic can be found in the Scout Architecture Documentation.

==== Create WAR Files

We are now ready to move the `Hello World` application from our development environment to a productive setup.
The simplest option to move our application into the 'wild' is to build it using Maven.
This produces two WAR files footnote:[
Web application ARchive (WAR): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_file_format_%28Sun%29
].

The first WAR file contains the Scout backend server with all business logic.
The second WAR file contains the Scout frontend server that is responsible for communicating with the web browser part of the Scout application.

To start the build right click on the project `helloworld` and select the context menu menu:Run As -> Maven build...[] as shown in <<img-sdk_export_war>>.
In the dialog that appears enter `clean verify` into the `Goals` field and press btn:[Run].

Afterwards the compilation starts, executes all test cases and bundles the result into two WAR files. The output of the build is shown in the Console view within Eclipse.
As soon as the build is reporting success you can find the built WAR files:

* The Scout backend WAR file `org.eclipse.scout.apps.helloworld.server.war` in folder `workspace_root/helloworld.server.app.war/target`
* The Scout frontend WAR file `org.eclipse.scout.apps.helloworld.ui.html.war` in folder `workspace_root/helloworld.ui.html.app.war/target`

To see the new files within Eclipse you may need to refresh the `target` folder below each project using the F5 keystroke.

=== Deploy to Tomcat

As the final step of this tutorial, we deploy the two WAR files representing our "`Hello World`" application to a Tomcat web server.
For this, we first need a working Tomcat installation.
If you do not yet have such an installation you may want to read and follow the instructions provided in Appendix <<apx-install_tomcat>>.
To verify a running Tomcat instance, type http://localhost:8080/ into the address bar of the web browser of your choice.
You should then see the page shown in <<img-deploy_tomcat_1>>.

[[img-deploy_tomcat_1, Tomcat start page]]
.The Tomcat shown after a successful installation. After clicking on the "`Manager App`" button (highlighted in red) the login box is shown in front. A successful login shows the "`Tomcat Web Application Manager`".

Once the web browser displays the successful running of your Tomcat instance, switch to its "`Manager App`" by clicking on the button highlighted in <<img-deploy_tomcat_1>>.
After entering user name and password the browser will display the "`Tomcat Web Application Manager`" as shown in <<img-deploy_tomcat_2>>.
If you don't know the correct username or password you may look it up in the file [filename]+tomcat-users.xml+ as described in Appendix <<apx-tomcat_dirs_and_files>>.

[[img-deploy_tomcat_2, Tomcat Manager]]
.The "`Tomcat Web Application Manager`". The WAR files to be deployed can then be selected using button "`Choose File`" highlighted in red.
image::{imgsdir}/tomcat_managerapp_selectwar.png[]

After logging into Tomcat's manager application, you can select the WAR files to be deployed using button "`Choose File`" according to the right hand side of <<img-deploy_tomcat_2>>.
After picking your just built [filename]+org.eclipse.scout.apps.helloworld.server.war+ and closing the file chooser, click on button "`Deploy`" (located below button "`Choose File`") to deploy the application to the Tomcat web server.
Then we repeat this step with the second WAR file [filename]+org.eclipse.scout.apps.helloworld.ui.html.war+.

This will copy the selected WAR files into Tomcats [filename]+webapps+ directory and unpack its contents into subdirectories with the same name.
You can now connect to the application using the browser of your choice and enter the following address:

----
  http://localhost:8080/org.eclipse.scout.apps.helloworld.ui.html/
----

[[img-helloworld_running_download, Figure Login Page]]
.The "`Hello World`" login page.
image::{imgsdir}/tomcat_helloworld_download.png[]

Then you will see the login page as shown in <<img-helloworld_running_download>>. Two users have been pre defined: "`admin`" with password "`admin`" and "`scott`" with password "`tiger`".
You can find this configuration in the [filename]+config.properties+ file of the application.

Please note: In a productive environment it is recommended to deploy the server and the user interface into two different servlet containers running on dedicated machines. 
This because these two tiers have different requirements on resources, load balancing and access protection.
Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to use an encrypted connection (e.g. TLS 1.2 footnote:[TLS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security]) 
between client browsers and the Scout frontend server AND between the Scout frontend and and backend server!
