Start your Eclipse IDE and select an empty directory for your workspace. 
This workspace directory will then hold all the project code for the `Hello World` application. 
Once the Eclipse IDE is running it will show the Java perspective.
To create a new Scout project select the menu menu:File[New,Project...] and type "`Scout Project`" in the wizard search field.
Select the Scout Project wizard and press btn:[Next].

In the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard you have to enter a `group id`, `artifact id` and a `display name` for your Scout project. 
As the created project will make use of https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html[Maven naming conventions] to choose  `group id` and `artifact id` for your project.
The `artifact id` will then also be the project name in the Eclipse workspace. The `display name` is used as the application name presented to the user (e.g. in the Browser title bar).

For the `Hello World` application just use the already prefilled values as sown in <<img-sdk_new_project_wizard>>.
Then, click the btn:[Finish] button to let the Scout SDK create the initial project code for you.

Depending on your Eclipse installation some `Maven plugin connectors` may be missing initially. In that case a dialog as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_connector>> may be shown.
Please choose the desired actions from the combo box in the `Action` column until all mappings are green.
E.g. for the `compiler-plugin` choose `Install M2E connector for the Eclipse JDT Compiler` from the combo box.
Afterwards the selected connectors are resolved and you need to confirm the installation, accept the license, accept that some content has not been signed and restart Eclipse afterwards.
To read more about `Maven plugin connectors` please refer to the https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-execution-not-covered.html[m2e documentation].
