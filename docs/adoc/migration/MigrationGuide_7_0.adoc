== API Changes (Java)

=== New Scout Modules for Jackson-based REST Services

The following new Scout modules have been added to support REST services with Jackson as marshaller:

* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest`
* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.test`
* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.jackson`
* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.jackson.test`

In order to use REST services based on the JAX-RS Jersey implementation, the following section must be added to the project `web.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- JAX-RS Jersey Servlet -->
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>api</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer</servlet-class>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>javax.ws.rs.Application</param-name>
    <param-value>org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.RestApplication</param-value>
  </init-param>
  <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
----

The `RestApplication` class searches for all implementations of `IRestResource` and exposes them as REST services.

=== Removed properties "enabledProcessing" on IButton and IAction

When a user performs two consecutive clicks on a button or a menu within a very short period of time, the action is executed twice. In some cases, this is an unwanted behavior. A new property "preventDoubleClick" was added to IButton and IMenu to disable it (see release notes).

In older Scout versions, two flags (`m_enabledProcessing` and `m_enabledProcessingAction`, respectively) were use to accomplish a
similar objective. Whenever the click/action handler was started, the flag was set to `false`, and set back to `true` at the end of the execution. A second call to the method had no effect. However, this logic no longer works since the introduction of the HTML UI. The new UI strictly allows _only one_ UI event to work on the client model simultaneously (subsequent click events are hold back by the _UiSession_ lock). Consequently, the "enabledProcessing" flag is never `false`, and no clicks are prevented.

Because this construct no longer works, the corresponding properties and methods were removed, namely:

* [line-through]#`AbstractButton: m_enabledProcessing`#
* [line-through]#`IButton/AbstractButton: isEnabledProcessing()`#
* [line-through]#`IButton/AbstractButton: setEnabledProcessing()`#
* [line-through]#`IButton/AbstractButton: disarm()`#
* [line-through]#`ButtonEvent: TYPE_DISARM`#
* [line-through]#`AbstractAction: m_enabledProcessingAction`#
* [line-through]#`IAction/AbstractAction: isEnabledProcessingAction`#

*Migration*: Delete any code that references any of the removed methods. There is not replacement, as the whole concept became disfunctional with the HTML UI. To prevent accidental double clicks, use the new `getConfiguredPreventDefault()` property. If for very rare and special cases such a flag is required, it has to be implemented manually by overriding `AbstractButton.doClick()` and `AbstractAction.doAction()`.

=== Added HTTP Abstraction Layer Google HTTP Client.

If your application previously used a custom (not provided by Scout) implementation of the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.servicetunnel.http.HttpServiceTunnel` class a migration might be necessary. For the service tunnel and a few other HTTP usages a new HTTP abstraction layer (Google HTTP Client 1.22) was introduced to support different low-level HTTP libraries (previously just the `java.net.HttpURLConnection` was used). The new default low-level HTTP library is the Apache HTTP Client 4.5.3, more details are available in the release notes. As the `java.net` connections are not used anymore by default the MultiSessionCookieStore (for `java.net` connections) is not installed by default (could be installed manually).

For the `HttpServiceTunnel`class the method `URLConnection createURLConnection(ServiceTunnelRequest call, byte[] callData)` has been replaced by
`HttpResponse executeRequest(ServiceTunnelRequest call, byte[] callData)`, also several methods (`addCustomHeaders`, `addSignatureHeader`, `addCorrelationId`, `createAuthToken` and `interceptHttpResponse`) signatures have changed their `URLConnection` parameter to either a `HttpRequest` or `HttpResponse` parameter. The same migration applies for subclasses of the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.servlet.HttpProxy` class.

=== IGroupBox: Changed Behavior of "getGridColumnCount"

The function `getGridColumnCount()` returned the calculated column count of the grid. This has been changed so that it returns the configured one which is not necessarily the same.

Example: the default of the property `gridColumnCount` is -1 which will typically result in 2 columns.

So in case you used this method, you should consider calling `getFieldGrid().getGridColumnCount()` instead.

=== ScoutTexts
Removed support for session scope specific `ScoutTexts` instances because support of scoped services was removed in Scout without OSGi (version >= 5.0).

Changes:

* `ScoutTexts` is now an application-scoped bean
* `ScoutTexts.CURRENT` thread local removed without replacement (use `BEANS.get(ScoutTexts.class)` instead)

Deprecations (methods will be removed in P-release):

* `ScoutTexts.get` -> `TEXTS.get`
* `ScoutTexts.getInstance()` -> `BEANS.get(ScoutTexts.class)`
* `ISession.getTexts()` -> `BEANS.get(ScoutTexts.class)`
* `AbstractSqlService.getConfiguredNlsProvider()` -> method is not used anymore (returns `null`)
* `AbstractSqlService.getNlsProvider()` -> method is not used anymore (returns `null`)

== API Changes (JavaScript)

=== render()
The parameter `$parent` has been removed from the `_render` method because `this.$parent` is available for every widget. There is no need to have a parameter `$parent` which points to the same variable. Use `this.$parent` instead.

Also `$parent` is now optional when calling widget.render(). The `$parent` may be resolved using `this.parent`. No need to always write
`widget.render(this.$container)` anymore, instead just write `widget.render()` if the `$container` of the `parent` should be used as `$parent`.

=== Promises
With jQuery 3 the promise API is now Promises/A+ compliant. This means you may need to adjust your code if you use promises.

We noticed the following effects:

- If a rejection is catched using a fail handler, the fail handler has
to return a rejected promise as well, otherwise the next success handler
would be called instead of the next fail handler.
- Every callback is now executed asynchronously. This is especially
relevant for the tests.
- Catch has been added -> replace fail(null, func) for better
readability.

See also https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/ for details.

=== Removed addClassSVG, removeClassSVG, attrSVG, removeAttrSVG
These functions are now supported by jQuery directly. Just use `addClass`, `removeClass`, `attr` and `removeAttr`.

=== Property Change Event
The property change event has been simplified.

The event had 3 properties:

* [line-through]#`newProperties`#
* [line-through]#`oldProperties`#
* [line-through]#`changedProperties`#

This was added to be able to react to multiple property change events at
once. Since 6.1, bulk property changes don't exist anymore, so there is
no need for these properties anymore.

Now, with 7.0, the property change event has the following properties:

* `propertyName`
* `oldValue`
* `newValue`

This makes handling the event easier. Check your propertyChange event handlers and adjust them accordingly.

=== Logical Grid Validation
Automatic Grid Data Validation has been introduced. This means there is no need to manually create a Logical Grid (e.g. `VerticalSmartGroupBoxBodyGrid` or `HorizontalGroupBoxBodyGrid` and validate it anymore, this will be done by the `LogicalGridLayout` itself. Also, check your JSON files, remove any explicit x, y grid definitions because they will be calculated by the `LogicalGrid`. Make sure to always use the property `gridDataHints` instead of `gridData`.

=== Event Naming
The naming of the events has been harmonized to conform with the event naming guide. This is only relevant, if you attached listeners using JavaScript or if you do some kind of load testing using the events in the requests.

The following changes have been made:

* Rename `doAction` to `action`
* Rename `linkPageWithRow` to `pageRowLink`
* Rename `initPage` to `pageInit`
* Rename `exportToClipboard` to `clipboardExport`
* Rename `parseerror` to `parseError`
* Rename `selectionChanged` to `selectionChange`
* Rename `callAction` to `action`
* Remove `insertText`
* Rename `popupopen` to `popupOpen`
* Rename `locationChanged` to `locationChange`
* Rename `sessionready` to `sessionReady`
* Rename `desktopcreated` to `desktopReady`
* Rename `positionChanged` to `positionChange`
* Rename `scrollstart` to `scrollStart`
* Rename `scrollend` to `scrollEnd`
* Rename `clicked` to `click`
* Rename `modelChanged` to `modelChange`
* Rename `selectionChanged` to `selectionChange`
* Rename `viewRangeChanged` to `viewRangeChange`
* Rename `formActivated` to `formActivate`
* Rename `historyEntryActivated` to `historyEntryActivate`
* Rename `viewAdded` to `viewAdd`
* Rename `viewRemoved` to `viewRemove`
* Rename `viewActivated` to `viewActivate`
* Rename `viewDeactivated` to `viewDeactivate`
* Rename `tabClicked` to `click`
* Rename `tabSelected` to `tabSelect`
* Rename `nodeClicked` to `nodeClick`
* Rename `rowClicked` to `rowClick`
* Rename `rowsSorted` to `sort`
* Remove `sortRows`

* Rename `exportToClipboard` to `clipboardExport`
* Rename `rowsFiltered` to `filter`

== Other Changes

=== Maven "provided" Dependencies

In Maven dependencies with the scope provided are not transitive.
This makes sense if a dependency is set to provided depending on the environment.
Any artifacts that are not intended to be used in a certain environment should not have the scope provided and are therefore now transitive.
We removed any current dependency `javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api` except for the one in the artifact `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons`.

To migrate your project, remove any dependency to `javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api`, `javax.xml.ws:jaxws-api` or `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`.
Then add to all artifacts with packaging type war the dependency to `javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api` with scope provided.
Depending on the container, you may want also to add the depdendency `javax.xml.ws:jaxws-api` with scope provided to the war artifact.

[source,xml]

  <artifactId>myproject.server.war</artifactId>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>myproject</groupId>
      <artifactId>myproject.server</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- provided by container -->

      <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
      <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
