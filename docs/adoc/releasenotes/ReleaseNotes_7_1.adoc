// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Java 8 required

The required Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run an Eclipse Scout application has changed: Starting with Eclipse Scout 7.1, a *Java 8 runtime is required*.

TIP: The Scout 7.1 Runtime does not support Java 9 yet. The Java 9 support is planned for Eclipse _Photon_ release (Scout 8.0) in summer 2018.

== New SDK Feature in Eclipse: Search for missing NLS keys

If NLS keys are used in the code that do not exist in a properties file, an ugly placeholder is displayed to the user. To find such missing translations the new Menu `Scout -> Search missing text keys...` may be handy.
The result is listed in the Eclipse `Search` view.

The search also takes the scope of each NLS key into account. So that the key is considered to be available there must be a `TextProviderService` with that key on the classpath of that module.

Reported false positives can be suppressed using the following comment at the end of the corresponding line: `NO-NLS-CHECK`. Matches on that line are then not reported in future searches anymore.

== Config Properties

=== Descriptions
Config properties based on `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` include a description text. This description is stored in the new `description()` method.

The class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigDescriptionExporter` can be used to export these descriptions. By default an AsciiDoctor exporter is included.

All Scout properties have been extended with descriptions. The same text is also part of the technical documentation.

=== Default value
Config properties based on `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` include a default value. The default value is stored in the `getDefaultValue()` method.

The method was moved  from `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.AbstractConfigProperty<DATA_TYPE, RAW_TYPE>` to the interface. Therefore the visibility has changed from protected to public.

=== Validation
The concrete implementation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigPropertyValidator` which validates the configuration of `config.properties` files will also check if a configured value matches the default value.
In case it does a info message (warn in development mode) will be logged but platform will still start.
To minimize configuration files such entries should be removed from `config.properties` files.

== GroupBox Enhancements

=== Layout Configuration
It is now possible to adjust the parameters of how the group box will be layouted. The following parameters may be set:

hgap:: the horizontal gap in pixels to use between two logical grid columns
vgap:: the vertical gap in pixels to use between two logical grid rows
columnWidth:: the width in pixels to use for a grid column
rowHeight:: the height in pixels to use for a grid row
minWidth:: the minimum width of the group box. If this width is > 0 a horizontal scrollbar is shown when the group box gets smaller than this value.

These values may be set using `getConfiguredBodyLayoutConfig()`.

[[sec-gb-sublabel]]
=== Sublabel
GroupBoxes got a new property called `sublabel`. The sublabel is displayed below the title in a very small font.

== Introducing Widget.java

On JavaScript side, there has been a class `Widget.js` for a long time now. With this release the counterpart `Widget.java` has been added. This gives all existing widgets like `FormField`, `Form`, `MessageBox`, `Menu` etc. a new common base class. It also helps creating widgets which aren't necessarily form fields.

== Widget.js: New Argument for clone()

The _clone()_ function of any widget got an `options` parameter. The options define what properties and events are synchonized between the widget and its clone.

== New Widget 'TileGrid'

The new `TileGrid` widget arranges `Tile` s in a grid by using the `LogicalGridLayout`. This is the same layout as used for a `GroupBox`, so the same `GridData` object may be used to configure how the individual tiles should be arranged.

A `Tile` directly extends `Widget` and is not much more than a `<div>` with the CSS class `tile`. In order to customize your tile you have to create a custom widget, which is easier than it sounds. Just create a JS class lets say `CustomTile.js` which extends from `Tile.js`, create a Java class `CustomTile.java` which extends from `AbstractTile.java` and add some glue code to link them together. See the code of the demo widgets on https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/7.1.x/code/widgets/org.eclipse.scout.widgets.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/widgets/client/ui/tiles[GitHub] for details. You could also use existing widgets as tiles. In that case instead of extending `AbstractTile` you would extend `AbstractWidgetTile` or `AbstractFormFieldTile` and set the property `tileWidget` accordingly.

In order to add the `TileGrid` to a form, you can use the class `TileField` which is basically a simple `FormField` wrapping the `TileGrid`. You cannot use the `TileGrid` directly because a `GroupBox` only accepts `FormField` s.

A demo of the widget may be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?dl=widget-tilefield.

And here for the JS only version:  https://scout.bsi-software.com/jswidgets/#tilefield.

== New Widget 'Accordion'

The `Accordion` displays several collapsible `Group` s. The default behavior is to collapse every other group if one group is expanded. Because that is not in any case desired, the behavior may be disabled by setting the property `exclusiveExpand` to false.

The `Group` is a simple widget containing of a header and a body. The body may be any other widget like the new `TileGrid`. Because having tiles in an accordion is a typical use case, there is a widget called `TileAccordion` which helps creating the groups and provides some delegate methods to easily access the tiles of every group. It also takes care that selecting multiple tiles across the individual groups works as there were only one single `TileGrid`.

== Menu, Menubar Enhancements

=== Form Field in Menu
The menubar now supports form field menu items (`FormFieldMenu`). On the model side extend `AbstractFormFieldMenu` with a form field as an inner class to use a form field menu in any menu supporting environment.
[[img-form-field-menu]]

=== New Property 'stackable'
The menu property `stackable` defines if a menu is stackable or not. A stackable menu will be moved to the ellipsis dropdown menu when there is not enough space in the menubar. The ellipsis menu is placed after the last stackable menu in the menubar. Right and left aligned menus will be moved to a single ellipsis menu per menubar. The horizontal alignment of the ellipsis menu is the same as the last stackable menu in the menubar.

== Tabbox Enhancements
=== Left Aligned Menu Items
The menubar of a tabbox now considers the menu alignments _left_ and _right_. That means you can add menus directly on the right side of the last tab item (left aligned) or at the right side of the tab box header (right aligned).

=== Collapsible Menu Items
Menus in the menubar will be moved to an ellipsis menu in case there is not enough space in the tabbox header. The tab items are moved to an ellipsis menu when there is not enough space for all tabs. The collapse order is as following: all menus are collapsed first before the tabs will be collapsed from right to left.

=== Sublabel
TabItems got a `sublabel` property which is displayed in a very small font below the title (see also <<sec-gb-sublabel>>).

=== Animated Selection Marker
The marker of the selected tab is now animated and follows the user or model selection.

=== Optimized Zoom Behavior
Several bugfixes of pixel issues due to zoom levels.

== Desktop Splitter Position Remembered Across sessions

The position of the desktop splitter position (between the navigation and the bench) is now persisted across sessions, i.e. the previous setting will be restored even after you closed your browser. The position is stored in the HTML 5 _local storage_ provided by the local browser. It is therefore a device-specific setting, which is especially useful when accessing the same application through screens with different resolutions.

In case the splitter position should never be remembered, the feature can be disabled globally by setting the property `cacheSplitterPosition` on the desktop to _false_.

== ImageField: Support for SVG Images and Image URLs

It's now possible to use SVG images in the same way as bitmap images. Simply put the .svg file in the `/icons` folder of the client module and reference the SVG image in any widget that supports the `iconId` property. Example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected String getConfiguredIconId() {
  return "person.svg";
}
----

Additionally you can now reference an image by URL, for instance an image hosted on an external server. Use the property ´imageUrl` of the AbstractImageField to reference the image. Note: the AbstractImageField defines a priority for which one of the three image properties is used to render the image in the browser:

1. _image_ (Binary resource)
2. _imageUrl_
3. _imageId_

== CheckBoxField: add support for key strokes
The check box field (`IBooleanField`) got a new property called `keyStroke`. The property expects a string defining the key stroke, e.g. `ctrl-b`. When the key stroke is executed the check box value will be toggled. Other widgets like `Button`, `RadioButton` or `Menu` already support that feature in the same way.

== Dynamic Fields

It is now possible to add and remove fields dynamically also when a form is already started. This feature is supported for `GroupBoxes` and `TabBoxes`.

The Java API orders the added fields considering the `order` member.

API:

* TabBox.js `insertTabItem`, `deleteTabItem`, `setTabItems`
* GroupBox.js `setFields`, `insertField`, `insertFieldBefore`, `deleteField`
* ICompositeField.java `setFields` and the already existing `addField`, `removeField` methods which don't throw an exception anymore when a form is already initialized.

[NOTE]
====
- The support for adding ProcessButtons dynamically is not implemented so far.
- Adding a field to container (`TabBox`, `GroupBox`) forces the container to be rendered. All fields in this container will be removed and rendered again.
====

== Form Fields

=== New Field Style
This release introduces a new field style called `alternative`. This is the new default style for every form field. The `classic` style is still available because it may be preferable in some circumstances, e.g. when used in a cell editor or on a form with background color like the search form. For these two cases the style is set to `classic` automatically but you can do it for your custom cases as well by setting the new property `FieldStyle`.

If you want to revert your whole application to the classic style you can create an extension to `AbstractFormField` and change the default of the `FieldStyle` property. For Scout JS applications you can set the variable `scout.FormField.DEFAULT_FIELD_STYLE` to  `scout.FormField.FieldStyle.CLASSIC`;

[[img-form-field-alternative-style]]

image::{imgsdir}/formfield_alternative.png[]

=== Improved Accessibility

The label and the input are now linked by using `aria-labelledby`. This allows screen readers to read the label if an input is focused.

Furthermore, clicking the label will now activate the field. This is especially helpful on mobile devices when the new alternative style is active, because the field boundaries are not obvious anymore.

== Enhanced IUiServletRequestHandler

UI Servlet request handler now supports all HTTP methods and not only GET and POST.
When using `AbstractUiServletRequestHandler` no migration should be required, see migration guide for further information.

== Automatic Preloading of Web Fonts

To prevent incorrect measurements or the so-called "FOUT effect" (Flash Of Unstyled Text), Scout tries to preload all necessary web font files (*.woff) before rendering the application. To make it easier for projects to add theme-dependent fonts, the font preloader has been improved. The list of fonts to preload is now detected automatically by inspecting the document's style sheet (_@font-face_ rules). It's no longer necessary to manually list all fonts in the bootstrap argument of `scout.App` (see migration guide).
