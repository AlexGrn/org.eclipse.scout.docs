= What's New

== Mnemonics
Mnemonics are not supported anymore. All affected texts were either edited or removed because they are not used anymore.

== Strong content security policy CSP
The stronger CSP disables inline javscript in html. Therefore the 'New Scout Project' wizard now creates a js file
per html file and includes it using the script element.

== Binary resources in different widgets
Binary resources such as images or videos can now be used in the following widgets:
* HtmlField
* BeanField
[[img-binary_resource_field, Figure 000]]
.Binary resource on a model field.
image::{imgsdir}/binary_resource_field.png[]
* Html enabled StringColumn
* BeanColumn
[[img-binary_resource_column, Figure 000]]
.Binary resource on a column
image::{imgsdir}/binary_resource_column.png[]

== Added tristate capability to checkbox and boolean column
Added support for tristate to checkbox and boolean column.
The new property tristateEnabled controls whether the checkbox/column behaves as a normal checkbox (false)
or a tristate checkbox (true).
A normal checkbox has values true/false. A tristate checkbox has values true/false/null. The null value is
interpreted as undefined and rendered as a filled square.
