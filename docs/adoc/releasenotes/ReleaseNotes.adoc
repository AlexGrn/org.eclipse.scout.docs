= What's New

== Table
=== Table is now responsive
With release 6.0, the columns of a table got very small if autoResizeColumns was set to true. The content was not readable in many cases. This has been improved with 6.0.1: The configured width is not only used as ratio to calculate the real width anymore, it now acts as minimum width as well. It is not a hard minimum, the user can still make the column smaller.
See also the link:{migrationguide}#changed-behavior-for-tables-with-autoresizecolumns-true[Migration Guide] for more information.

Furthermore, the table header menu is now responsive as well. If there is not enough space the menu gets smaller and vertically scrollable.
