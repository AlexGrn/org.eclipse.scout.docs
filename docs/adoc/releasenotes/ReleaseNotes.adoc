= Releases

== Oxygen
This version is under development and scheduled for release in June 2017.

* Download SDK: link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-scout-developers/oxygenm2[Eclipse for Scout Developers]
* Runtime on Maven Central: link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.scout.rt%22[6.1.0.x]

=== What's New

==== Strong content security policy CSP
The stronger CSP disables inline javscript in html. Therefore the 'New Scout Project' wizard now creates a js file
per html file and includes it using the script element. To migrate existing projects, see the link:{migrationguide}[Scout 6.1 Migration Guide].

==== Binary resources support for HtmlField and BeanField
Binary resources such as images or videos can now be used in the following widgets:
* HtmlField
* BeanField
[[img-binary_resource_field, Figure 000]]
.Binary resource on a model field.
image::{imgsdir}/binary_resource_field.png[]
* Html enabled StringColumn
* BeanColumn
[[img-binary_resource_column, Figure 000]]
.Binary resource on a column
image::{imgsdir}/binary_resource_column.png[]

==== TriState capability for check boxes
Added support for tri-state value (`true`, `false` and `null` instead of just `true` and `false`) to boolean field and boolean column.

The new property `triStateEnabled` controls whether the boolean field/column behaves as a normal checkbox (false)
or a tri-state checkbox (true).

A normal checkbox has values true/false. A tri-state checkbox has values true/false/null. The null value is
interpreted as "undefined" and rendered as a filled square.

==== New UriOpenAction: SAME_WINDOW
The enum `UriOpenAction` provides a new value to open a URI in the current window: `SAME_WINDOW`

==== New methods in StringUtility
`StringUtility` provides the following new methods:

* `containsString()`
* `containsStringIgnoreCase()`
* `containsRegEx()`
* `matches()`
* `endsWidth()`
* `startsWith()`
* `length()`
* `indexOf()`
* `lastIndexOf()`

All methods are null-safe, unit tested and documented with JavaDoc.

==== New form field property "preventInitialFocus"
By default, the first enabled field on a form gets the focus when the form is opened. This may not be desired in some cases (e.g. if the first field is a HTML field that contains app links). The new property `PROP_PREVENT_INITIAL_FOCUS` can be used to prevent the initial focus to be set to this field. The default value is `false`. For `AbstractHtmlField` and `AbstractBeanField`, the default is set to `true`.
