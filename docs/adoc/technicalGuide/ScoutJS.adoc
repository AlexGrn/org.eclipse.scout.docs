== Scout JS
A classic Scout application has a client model written in Java, and a UI which is rendered using JavaScript. With this approach you can write your client code using a mature and type safe language. Unfortunately you cannot develop applications which have to run offline because the UI and the Java model need to be synchronized.

With Scout JS this will change. You will be able to create applications running without a UI server because there won't be a Java model anymore. The client code will be written using JavaScript (or TypeScript) and executed directly in the browser.

You still don't have to care about how the model will be rendered. There isn't a strict separation of the UI and the model anymore, but that doesn't mean you have to write HTML and CSS. You can of course, if you want to. But typically you will be using the Scout widgets you already know.

=== Widget
A widget is a component which may be rendered. It may be simple like a label, or more complex like a tree or table. A form is a widget and a form field, too.
A widget contains the model, which represents the state of the widget. In a Scout Classic application, that model will be sent from the UI server to the browser and the Scout UI will use that model to create the widget. In a Scout JS app, the model may be provided using JSON or directly with JavaScript.

==== Lifecycle
Every widget has a lifecycle. After a widget is instantiated, it has to be initialized using `init`. If you want to display it, you have to call the `render` method. If you want to remove it from the DOM, call the `remove` method. Removing a widget is not the same as destroying it. You can still use it, you can for example change some properties and then render it again. If you really don't need it anymore, call the `destroy` method.

So you see the widget actually has 3 important states:

* initialized
* rendered
* destroyed

The big advantage of this concept is that the model of the widget may be changed any time, even if the widget is not rendered. This means you can prepare a widget like a form, prepare all its child widgets like the form fields, and then render them at once. If you want to hide the form, just remove it. It won't be displayed anymore, but you can still modify it, like changing the label of a field or adding rows to a table. The next time it is rendered the changes will be reflected. If you do such a modification when it is rendered, it will be reflected immediately.

Destroying a widget means it will detach itself from the parent and destroy all children. If you have attached listeners to other widgets at initialization time, now is the time to detach them. After a widget is destroyed it cannot be used anymore. Every attempt will result in a `Widget is destroyed` error.

==== Creating a Widget
A widget may be created using the constructor function or `scout.create`. Best practice is to always use `scout.create` which gives you two benefits:

1. You don't have to call `init` by yourself.
2. The widget may be extended (see chapter ObjectFactory for details).

The following example creates a `StringField`.

[source,javascript]
----
var field = scout.create('StringField', {
  parent: groupBox,
  label: 'hello',
  value: 'world'
};
----

The first parameter is the object type, which typically is the name of the constructor function preceded by the name space. `StringField` belongs to the `scout` name space which is the default and may be omitted. If your widget is part of another name space you have to specify it like following:

[source,javascript]
----
scout.create('scout.StringField', {});
----

The second parameter of scout.create is the model. The model actually is the specification for your widget. In case of the `StringField` you can specify the label, the max length, whether it is enabled and visible and more. If you don't specify them, the defaults are used. The only needed property is the `parent`. To see what the defaults are, have a look at the source code of the widget constructor.

Every widget needs a parent. The parent is responsible to render (and remove) its children. In the example above, the parent is a group box. This group box has a property called `fields`. If the group box is rendered, it will render its fields too.

You don't need a group box to render the string field, you could render it directly onto the desktop. But if you want to use a form, you need a group box and create the form, group box and the field. Doing this programmatically is time consuming, that is why we suggest to use the declarative JSON based approach.

==== Creating a Widget using JSON
Using the JSON based approach makes it easier to specify multiple widgets in a structured way. The following example defines a fom with a group box and a string field.

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "example.MyForm",
  "type": "model",
  "title": "My first form!",
  "rootGroupBox": {
    "id": "MainBox",
    "objectType": "GroupBox",
    "mainBox": true,
    "borderDecoration": "empty",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "MyStringField",
        "objectType": "StringField",
        "label": "hello",
        "value": "world"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

This description of the form is put in a separate file called `MyForm.json`. Typically you would create a file called `MyForm.js` as well, which contains the logic to interact with the fields. But since we just want to open the form it is not necessary. Instead you can use the following code to create the form:

[source,javascript]
----
scout.create('Form', scout.models.getModel('example.MyForm', parent));
----

When the form is shown it will look like this:

[[img-scoutjs_myform, Figure 000]]
.A form described using JSON
image::{imgsdir}/scoutjs_myform.png[]

==== Icons
Widgets that have a property `iconId` (for instance `Menu`) can display an icon. This iconId references
an icon which can be either a bitmap image (GIF, PNG, JPEG, etc.) or a character from an icon-font. An example
for an icon-font is the _scoutIcons.ttf_ which comes shipped with Scout.

Depending on the type (image, font-icon) the iconId property references:

* **Image**: iconId is an URL which points to an image resource accessible via HTTP.
+
Example: `/icons/person.png`
* **Font-icon**: iconId has the format `font:[UTF-character]`.
+
Example: `font:\uE043`, references a character in _scoutIcons.ttf_
+
Example: `font:fooIcons \uE109`, references a character in custom font _fooIcons.ttf_
* **Icon Constants**: iconId has the format: `${iconId:[constant]}`, where constant is a constant in `scout.icons`.
  This format is especially useful when you configure a Scout widget with a JSON model. The value of the constant
  is again either an image or a font-icon as described above.
+
Example: `${iconId:ANGLE_UP}` uses `scout.icons.ANGLE_UP`, icons predefined by Scout
+
Example: `${iconId:foo.BAR}` uses `foo.icons.BAR`, use this for custom icon constant objects

=== Extensibility

==== How to extend Scout objects

The extension feature in Scout JS works by wrapping functions on the prototype of a Scout object
with a wrapper function which is provided by an extension. The extension feature doesn't rely on
subclassing, instead we simply register one or more extensions for a single Scout class. When a
function is called on an extended object, the functions are called on the registered extensions
first. Since a Scout class can have multiple extensions, we speak of an extension chain, where the
last element of the chain is the original (extended) object.

The base class for all extensions is `scout.Extension`. This class is used to extend an existing
Scout object. In order to use the extension feature you must subclass +scout.Extension+ and
implement an `init` function, where you register the functions you want to extend. Example:

[source,javascript]
----
scout.MyExtension.prototype.init = function() {
  this.extend(scout.MyStringField.prototype, '_init');
  this.extend(scout.MyStringField.prototype, '_renderProperties');
};
----

Then you implement functions with the same name and signature on the extension class. Example:

[source,javascript]
----
scout.MyExtension.prototype._init = function(model) {
  this.next(model);
  this.extended.setProperty('bar', 'foo');
};
----

The extension feature sets two properties on the extension instance before the extended method
is called. These two properties are described below. The function scope (this) is set to the extension
instance when the extended function is called.

next:: is a reference to the next extended function or the original function of the extended object,
  in case the current extension is the last extension in the extension chain.
extended:: is the extended or original object.

All extensions must be registered in the `installExtensions` function of your `scout.App`.
Example:

[source,javascript]
----
scout.MyApp.prototype.installExtensions = function() {
  scout.Extension.install([
    'scout.FooExtension',
    'scout.BarExtension',
    // ...
  ]);
};
----

==== How to extend JSON model

TODO: Cyrill Wyss?

==== Export Scout model from a Scout classic (online) application

With the steps described here you can export model-data (e.g. forms, tables, etc.) from an existing classic, online Scout application into JSON format which
can be used in a Scout JS application. This is a fast and convenient method to re-use an existing form in a Scout JS application, because you don't have to
build the model manually. Here's how to use the export feature:

* Activate the `TextKeyTextProviderService` in your Scout classic application. You can do this either by calling the static `register` Method at
  runtime (using the Debugger) or by setting the config property _scout.text.providers.show.keys_. Once the TextProvider is active, it returns text keys instead
  of localized texts. The format of the returned string is `${textKey:[text-key]}`. Strings in this format are interpreted browser side by Scout JS and
  are resolved and localized in _texts.js_.
* Call the Scout classic web application with the URL parameter `?adapterExportEnabled=true`. This parameter is checked by Scout JS and the effect of it is that
  Scout JS keeps adapter-data loaded from the server, so we can use it for a later export operation. Usually Scout JS deletes adapter-data right after it has
  been used to create an adapter instance.
* Start your browsers developer tools (F12) from your running Scout classic app, inspect the form or another adapter you'd like to export, and search for
  the ID of that adapter by looking at the `data-id` attribute in the DOM. Then call the following JavaScript function from the console: `JSON.stringify(scout.exportAdapter([id]))`.
  The console will now output the JSON code for that adapter. Copy/paste that string from the console and tidy it up with a tool of your choice (for instance http://www.jsoneditoronline.org[jsoneditoronline.org]).
* Now the formatted JSON code is ready to be used in your Scout JS project. Simply store the JSON to a .json File and load it in the `_jsonModel` function of
  your widget by calling `scout.models.getModel('[ID of json model]')`. Most likely you must edit the JSON file and apply some changes manually.
  For instance:
  ** Replace numeric adapter IDs by human-readable, semantic string IDs. You will need these IDs to reference a model element from the JSON model in your
    JavaScript code, e.g. to register a listener on a Menu.
  ** Maybe you'll have to adjust objectType and namespace of some widgets in the JSON. This needs to be done for widgets
     that do not belong to the default _scout_ namespace.
  ** Remove form fields and menus which are never used in your Scout JS app
  ** Remove unused menu types from the menuTypes property of a scout.Menu

Note: The function exportAdapter can be used not only for forms, but for any other widget/adapter too.
