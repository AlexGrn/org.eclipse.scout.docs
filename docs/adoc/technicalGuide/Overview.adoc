== Overview

=== Threading and Jobs

Another fundament of Eclipse Scout's simplicity is the Client Job Queue.
Every logic processed on client side like calling services, opening a form, validating a field, etc. is run inside a ClientSyncJob and therefore synchronously.
As soon the processing is finished and the data ready to be displayed the GUI Thread takes over and displays the data.
This approach minimizes the execution time of the GUI Thread and therefore reduces the time of a blocking or freezing window.
