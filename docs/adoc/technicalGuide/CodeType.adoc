== Code Type

A CodeType is a structure to represent a tree key-code association. They are used in SmartField and SmartColumn.

* implements: `ICodeType<T>`
* extends: `AbstractCodeType<T>`

=== Description
CodeType are used in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/SmartField[SmartField] to let the user choose between a finish list of values. The value stored by the field correspond to the key of the selected code.

A CodeType can be seen as a tree of https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/Code[Codes]. Each code associate to the key (the Id) other properties: among others a Text and an IconId.

In order to have the same resolving mechanism (getting the display text of a key) CodeType are also used in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/SmartColumn[SmartColumn]. To chose multiple value of the list, the fields https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/ListBox[ListBox] (flat CodeType) and https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/TreeBox[TreeBox] (hierarchical CodeType) can be used.

==== Organisation of the codes

The codes are organized in a tree. Therefore a CodeType can have one or more child codes at the root level, and each code can have other child codes. In lot of cases a list of codes (meaning a tree containing only leafs at the first level) is sufficient to cover most of the need.

Child codes are ordered in their parent code. This is realized with the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/Order_Annotation[order annotation].

==== Type of the key

The type of the key is defined by its generic parameter `<T>`. It is very common to use a type from the `java.lang.*` package (like `Integer` or `String`) but any Java Object is suitable. It must:

* implements `Serializable`
* have correctly implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` functions
* present in the server and the client

There is no obligation to have the same type for the Id between the codes of a CodeType (meaning the same generic type parameter for the codes inner-class). However it is a good practice to have the same type between the codes of a CodeType, because the Id are used as value of https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/SmartField[SmartFields]. Therefore the generic parameter describing the type of value of a SmartField must be compatible with the type of the codes contained in the CodeType.

=== Using a CodeType

==== SmartField or SmartColumn

CodeType in a SmartField (or SmartColumn).

[source,java]
----
include::{codedir}/org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/codetype/YesOrNoSmartField.java[tags=YesOrNoSmartField]
----

If the SmartField (or SmartColumn) works with a CodeType, a specific LookupCall is instantiated to get the LookupRows based on the Codes contained in a CodeType.

==== Accessing a code directly

Scout-runtime will handle the instantiation and the caching of CodeTypes.

This function returns the text corresponding to the key using a CodeType:

[source,java]
----
include::{codedir}/org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/codetype/CodetypeExamples.java[tags=getCodeText]
----

=== Static CodeType

==== Java Code and structure

image::{imgsdir}/Scout_CodeType_Structure.png[]

The common way to define a CodeType is to extend AbstractCodeType. Each code is an inner-class extending AbstractCode. Like usual the properties of Codes and CodeTypes can be set with https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/Concepts/GetConfigured_Methods[getConfiguredXxxxxx()] methods.

See the Java Code of a simple `YesOrNoCodeType` having just two codes:

* `YesOrNoCodeType.YesCode`
* `YesOrNoCodeType.NoCode`

==== With the SDK

The SDK provides some help to generate CodeTypes and Codes.
Use File -> New -> Scout -> Scout Code Type to generate a new code.

=== Dynamic CodeType

Code types are not necessary hardcoded. It is possible to implement other mechanisms to load CodeType dynamically.

The description of the Codes can come from a database or from an XML files. If you want to do so, you just need to implement the method corresponding to the event LoadCodes.

It is possible to use the static and the dynamic approach together. In this case, if there is a conflict (2 codes for the same id) the event OverwriteCode is triggered.

Note for advanced users:

Each CodeType is instantiated for

* each language
* each partition

Note: A drawback that the CodeType Class is not aware of the language and the partition it is instantiate for. Only the  `CodeTypeStore` that manage the CodeType instances knows for which language and which partition they have been instantiated.
